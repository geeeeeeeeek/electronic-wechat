# Electronic WeChat

*A better WeChat on macOS and Linux. Built with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron).*

> **⚠️⚠️ NO LONGER IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT | 项目不再维护 ⚠️⚠️** 
> 
> Thanks for supporting this project for **1000** days since Feb 16, 2016.

> It started with the idea to make WeChat better on MacOS when the official support was abscent. It was de facto dead when Tencent rolled out a new WeChat and started to block other third-party clients. For me, it's no longer worthwhile to hack a lot to accomplish little. Hope this project had been helpful to you in any way. You're welcome to fork or make copies with a reference. HAPPY HACKING.

> 感谢历史上的用户和贡献者，你们已经陪伴这个项目走过了 **1000** 个日子。我曾经想要打造一个更好的 Mac 微信客户端，因为官方版本几年没有更新、bug 层出。而在腾讯自己开始了定期更新并限制第三方客户端时，这个项目实际已经没有什么意义。这个项目目前作为一个存档供大家学习。希望它曾经对你有所帮助，你也可以 fork 或者转载（标注来源）来进行修改。祝你玩得愉快。
